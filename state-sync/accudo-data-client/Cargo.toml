# Note: we cannot rely on the workspace version of rand because it's out-of-date
# and does not provide the necessary interfaces for weighted sampling. Similarly,
# it's not trivial to update rand on the workspace because of several dependency
# issues (e.g., other outdated crate versions). This is why we fix the version here.
# Eventually we'll need to update the workspace to use the latest version of rand.
# See also https://github.com/accudo-labs/accudo-core/issues/13031
